  <background>The 'Polish Tram' incident is an ideal example where the security breach into a system was responsible for compromising the safety of people in the form of passengers of tram. The incident was logged into 'The Repository of Industrial Security Incidents' in 2008 under the title of School Boy Hacks into Polish Tram System, where a 14-year old boy, a Polish student, hacked into the tram system which enabled him to change track points in Lodz, Poland.  Four trams were derailed. Twelve people were injured when a train derailed.  The boy built an infrared device that looked like a TV remote control that could control all the junctions on the line.  No deaths occurred.  The boy faced a special juvenile court on charges of endangering public safety. </background>
  <strategic_goals>The goal here is to summarize this Polish Tram case study in CAIRIS model and identify the missing safety elements in CAIRIS.</strategic_goals>

  <description>The 14 year old boy who was able to get into the Polish Tram Network and switch control junctions.
Four trams were derailed. Twelve people were injured when a train derailed. 
The boy built an infrared device that looked like a TV remote control that could control all the junctions on the line.  No deaths occurred.  
The boy faced a special juvenile court on charges of endangering public safety. </description>

  <activities>Adam is a teen-age IT student with good academic skills. Adam takes keen interest in his 'Electronics' class and is considered a genius by his teachers. After reading about railways during his school exercise, the boy has started to show some interest in railways. He has spent months studying about Lodz Tram System. He is often found killing his leisure time by trespassing at Tram Depots to gather information and equipment which can be re-used in creative ways. Apart from that, learning the coding skills from open-source public libraries by using internet is also his favorite job. </activities>
  <attitudes>Adam is a careless boy who is often found roaming around tram stations and not much concerned about trespassing or breaking any rules. He testified for breaking into the tram network and switching junctions. He is a boy who is just curious and lacks the money to fulfill his curiosity, hence learnt the coding for building infrared remote control from internet. His non-serious behavior as a teenager was responsible for triggering the chaos. 
There were problems with Lodz's Network Signaling System reported by the workers. But railway authorities disinterest in improving security provided this loop-hole. Adam was able to exploit this vulnerability by getting into the Lodz Tram Network and derail trams.
</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Adam has been found taking part in activities, where he was responsible for train derailments. Despite being not appreciated for his this passion, he tempts to use his knowledge in new and exciting ways. Recently he was found responsible for getting into Lodz Tram Network which caused the havoc. The device he used to control track points was found by police at his home. He has been sent to juvenile court on charges of endangering public safety.</aptitudes>
  <motivations>Adam as a young computer expert has broken into computer systems by exploiting their vulnerabilities. He wants to implement his knowledge in real world by getting into the tram network and maneuver the track points. A model student whose idea is to play with trains by considering them as his own giant personalized train set. A careless behavior displayed by a teenager who modified track points for fun, as a prank. Luckily there were no deaths. He has no intent to hurt people; he just forgot to think about the possible consequences.</motivations>
  <skills>Adam has experience working with small electronic projects during his school exercises. He has read about railway junctions as part of lesson during his class and also by observing nearby tram stations.

<persona name="Ben" type="Primary" assumption_persona="FALSE" image="" >
  <activities>Ben as train driver is managing his operations by the help of ERTMS Driver Machine Interface. Through ERTMS DMI Ben enters data into onboard system. Ben gets the information about his train route displayed on his DMI. In order to ensure safe movement of trains Ben takes action based on movement authority sent to him. 
There are some activities which Ben performs to ensure efficient movement of trains like switching of isolation mode. It is Ben's job to identify the End of Authority for trains. Ben's driving cab has ERTMS Reset and sometimes under special circumstances he has the authority to reset. It is Ben's job to keep on observing signals for danger and stop the train immediately to avoid accidents. 
</activities>
  <attitudes>Ben's driving cab is connected to ERTMS on-board equipment through which he gets the Driver Advisory Information like Driver ID, Train Running Number etc on his screen. Ben is also able to pass messages through ERTMS on-board equipment to ERTMS trackside equipment as a part of his routine. 
Ben is able to take operational control decisions of his vehicle by the help of information displayed on his ERTMS Driver Machine Interface. The ERTMS DMI displays him speed limit, train positions etc. He also gets alerts in case of any errors or warnings, and even change in supervision is communicated to him through ERTMS DMI. Ben has no room for making any mistakes while interpreting this information even when notified about stop markers.
A major part of his job is to get signal directives by communicating with train signaler. The train signaler is responsible for advising Ben about ERTMS mode required, maximum speed allowed, permission to precede movement etc. In case of any failure Ben is notified by signaler and he has to take appropriate actions accordingly. Ben's job will be compromised if due to momentary loss of signal detection he is unable to receive data packets which contain information on operations of trains transmitted via GSM-R technology.
</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Ben has a huge responsibility for controlling movement of trains which carries passengers and other staff members; hence he needs to remain vigilant during duty hours. His active state of mind is must for making accurate decisions during job. Sometimes during driving Ben even receives text messages as a part of ERTMS operational control job. These might be a cause of distraction and lead to safety hazards.
As a major part of his job, he is responsible for switching in between different ERTMS levels for train movement control. Ben is making all decisions by interacting with ERTMS Driver Machine Interface, thus the reliability and availability of ERTMS DMI is directly affecting his tasks efficiency.

  <activities>Daniel is performing the job of Signaler in an ERTMS area. As a signaler, he is responsible for the administration of train drivers by keeping track of their reported vehicle positions. Daniel updates the Route Settings as a part of ERTMS signaling control operations. He can initiate a cancellation request for a route upon certain circumstances, but he is not authorized enough to make signaling control decisions by himself. He has to make route decisions for train movement and ensure safety. 
Daniel working from his signalers workstation is responsible for monitoring and controlling the train movement safely and efficiently.
</activities>
  <attitudes>As a part of his routine, Daniel is supervising train drivers. The train drivers precede their journey based on directives from signaler. Daniel as a signaler plans the journey information based on ERTMS principles which becomes visible to train drivers. 
Daniel also keeps record of GSM-R status of every vehicle. In case, of any incident the investigation can be conducted using the traffic information kept as evidence by Daniel.
</attitudes>
  <aptitudes>Daniel has to be vigilant while make train signaling control and operation decisions, as they may lead to hazardous events if managed poorly. He has to ensure efficient regulation of trains. In order to fulfill safe operations, he has to be able to identify possible faults that could possibly compromise the safety. 
Daniel as management of ERTMS failures is authorized to inform the nature of faults identified during operation. He is also authorized to determine the failure impact on train operations and possible responses for these faults. After recovery of trains from system failures it is Daniels job to resume their usage. 
</aptitudes>
  <motivations>He has to manage the signaling control and operations for train movement, and has to make sure that safety of people is not compromised at any cost. The interoperability of control and command of signaling technical specifications is primary responsibility of Daniel. He has to advise train drivers regarding their movement, maximum speed and ERTMS mode required. In case of emergency, he also has to alert the train drivers. During train movement Daniel has to manage the closing of barriers and gates to road traffic. His maximum effort should be to minimize any possible hazardous events. 
Daniel has to make definite and sustained actions and anticipate errors even before their occurrence.
